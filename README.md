Velocity vector data from Lasickas et al. (2023) - Investigating the Effect of Woodwind Instrument Tone Hole Size Using Particle Image Velocimetry, Forum acusticum 2023, Torino


Here you can find 2000 temporal samples of PIV measurement data for each experimental case. The data is acquired using Phantom VEO 340 L and LaVision DaVis 10.2.1 software. The pre-processing was performed to extract velocity vectors using PaIRS-UniNa software. 

The .mat files contain: 

  U - horizontal velocity.

  V - vertical velocity.

  X - matrix the size of velocity matrices, where rows represent x location and all the rows contain the same information.

  Y - matrix the size of velocity matrices, where columns represent y location and all the columns contain the same information.


The exact experimental configuration and the pre-processing steps together with some results are published in Lasickas et al. (2023).
