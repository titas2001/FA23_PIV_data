Forum acusticum 2023 - Lasickas et al. - Investigating the Effect of Woodwind Instrument Tone Hole Size Using Particle Image Velocimetry

Here you can find 2000 temporal samples of PIV measurement data for each experimental case. The data is acquired using Phantom VEO 340 L and LaVision DaVis 10.2.1 software. The pre-processing was performed to extract velocity vectors using PaIRS-UniNa software. 
The exact experimental configuration and the pre-processing steps together with some results are published in [].
